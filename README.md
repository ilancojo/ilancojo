# Hi, I'm Ilan 👋

I'm a Computer Science student exploring backend development and data-driven projects.  
I build systems using C#, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and enjoy writing clean, structured code.

Here you'll find a mix of:
- Web development projects (ASP.NET, JS, HTML/CSS)
- Python scripts for data analysis and automation
- Coursework-based algorithm and data structure exercises

Always learning, always improving.
